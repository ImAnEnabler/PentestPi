PentestPi
========
Setup a RaspberryPi as a dropbox for Pentesting
-----------------------------------------------

-----

Initial configuration:

Installed Ubuntu 14. Update with:
* apt-get update
* apt-get upgrade
* apt-get dist-update


System changes made:
* Disabled ipv6 in /etc/sysctl.conf
* Installed ptf
*       github.com/trustedsec/ptf
*       To run, do ./ptf, then use modules/install_update_all
*       All tools get installed in /pentest/
* Installed cobaltstrike
* apt-get install tmux monit

Setup SSH Keys
Created dial-home for reverse SSH connection
        (as seen on http://www.tunnelsup.com/raspberry-pi-phoning-home-using-a-reverse-remote-ssh-tunnel)
        To use, it will try to connect to the server/port in ~/create_ssh_tunnel.sh


Setting up monit to watch services. Hopefully this will replace/resolve watchdog scripts and one-off setups for dialing home, uploading files, running responder, etc.
* Config is in /etc/monit/monitrc
* sudo monit -t           : Reviews config to make sure syntax is OK
* sudo monit reload       : reloads config
* sudo monit status       : Shows status of processes
* sudo monit restart all  : Restarts all services that monit controls
* Details are in /var/log/monit.log


Interesting problems:
        The Pi has no built in battery for a clock. Setting dates/times
                in logfiles isn't helpful.


Still todo:

1. Setup macchanger script to change MAC address and get new IP nightly
        Script is in /home/ubuntu, added to Root's cron
        Log of activity is in /home/ubuntu/log
2. Responder needs to start automatically. Looks like monit hangs sometimes. 
3. System needs to SCP responder logs regularly
4. Setup denyhosts
5. Firewall?
6. Test battery drain
7. Setup Kippo to capture SSH creds/Vuln scan attempts
